# Books reviewers review Analysis

SUMMARY AND OVERVIEW

Overall, the discovery of a book or author happens through both direct and indirect recommendations.

Among these recommendations are the opinions and ratings of other readers, which can influence our decision.

With this in mind, we sought to understand what motivates the high or low ratings of these reviews.

To do this, we examined the causal relationship between the length of the reviews, the sentiment of the reviews as calculated by a natural language processing algorithm, the total number of reviews, the number of followers, the number of likes on the reviews, and the review ratings.

The results of the relationship map show no causal relationship between the review ratings and the other variables. These ratings might therefore be more dependent on individual writing habits than on the review length.

We then sought to identify the words or terms that determine these ratings.

We observed that the words in 5-star reviews indicate joy, excitement, admiration, and emotion, while the words in 1-star reviews indicate frustration, disappointment, disgust, boredom, and confusion.
